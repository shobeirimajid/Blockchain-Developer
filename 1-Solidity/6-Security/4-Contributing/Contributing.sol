    Help is always welcome and there are plenty of options to contribute to Solidity.


    In particular, we appreciate support in the following areas:

        Reporting issues.

        Fixing and responding to Solidity’s GitHub issues, 
            especially those tagged as “good first issue” which are meant as introductory issues 
            for external contributors.

        Improving the documentation.

        Translating the documentation into more languages.

        Responding to questions from other users on 
            StackExchange and the Solidity Gitter Chat.

        Getting involved in the language design process 
            by proposing language changes or new features
             in the Solidity forum and providing feedback.


    To get started, you can try Building from Source in order to familiarize yourself 
    with the components of Solidity and the build process. 
    
    Also, it may be useful to become well-versed at 
    writing smart-contracts in Solidity.

    Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct.
     By participating in this project 
        — in the issues, pull requests, or Gitter channels — 
    you agree to abide by its terms.
