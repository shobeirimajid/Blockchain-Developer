    Contract Metadata
    ---------------------
    https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/metadata.html

    The Solidity compiler automatically generates a JSON file, 
    the contract metadata, 
    that contains information about the compiled contract. 
    
    You can use this file to query 
        the compiler version
        the sources used
        the ABI 
    and NatSpec documentation to more safely interact with the contract and verify its source code.

    The compiler appends by default the IPFS hash of the metadata file 
    to the end of the bytecode of each contract, 
    so that you can retrieve the file in an authenticated way
     without having to resort to a centralized data provider. 
     
     The other available options are the Swarm hash and not appending the metadata hash to the bytecode. 
     
     These can be configured via the Standard JSON Interface.
