    also called
        JULIA or IULIA

    Yul is an intermediate language that can be compiled to bytecode for different backends.

    It can be used in: 
        - stand-alone mode 
        - “inline assembly” inside Solidity
    
    The compiler uses Yul as an intermediate language in the IR-based code generator 
        “new codegen” or “IR-based codegen”
    
    Yul is a good target for high-level optimisation stages
     that can benefit all target platforms equally.
