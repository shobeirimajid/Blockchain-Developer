    Inline Assembly
    -----------------
    https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/assembly.html

    You can interleave Solidity statements with inline assembly 
    in a language close to the one of the "Ethereum Virtual Machine". 
    
    This gives you more fine-grained control, 
    which is especially useful when you are enhancing the language by writing libraries.

    The language used for "inline assembly" in Solidity is called "Yul" 
    and it is documented in its own section:

        https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html
    
    This section will only cover how the inline assembly code can interface with the surrounding Solidity code.
