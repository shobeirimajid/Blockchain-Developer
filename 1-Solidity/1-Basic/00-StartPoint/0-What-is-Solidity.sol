    Language Influences
    ----------------------
    Solidity is a curly-bracket language 
    and looks like most other curly-bracket languages


    Solidity has been influenced and inspired by several well-known programming languages:

        1- C++             most profoundly influenced by
        2- Python          concepts and semantics
        3- JavaScript      concepts and semantics



    (1) The influence from C++:

        - variable declarations
        - loops
        - functions overloading concept
        - type conversions (implicit and explicit)
        - and many other details
    


    (2) The influence from Python:

        - modifiers (Pythonâ€™s decorators - with a much more restricted functionality) 
        - multiple inheritance
        - C3 linearization
        - super keyword 
        - general assignment
        - value types 
        - reference types


    
    (3) The influence from JavaScript:

        In the early days, Solidity used to be partly influenced by JavaScript in: 

            - function-level scoping of variables
            - keyword var

        from Solidity version 0.4.0 The JavaScript influence was reduced 
        Now, Solidity has no major JavaScript influence anymore.

        remaining similarity to JavaScript is that:

            - keyword "function"
            - import
