/*
    ------------------------
    Modifier Overriding
    ------------------------
    Function modifiers can override each other. 
    This works in the same way as function overriding 
        except that there is no overloading for modifiers. 
        
    The virtual keyword must be used on the overridden modifier 
    and the override keyword must be used in the overriding modifier.


    In case of multiple inheritance, 
    all direct base contracts must be specified explicitly.
