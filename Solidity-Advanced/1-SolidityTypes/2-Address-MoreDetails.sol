            Address

            The address type comes in two flavours, which are largely identical:
                address: Holds a 20 byte value - size of an Ethereum address
                address payable: Same as address, but with the additional members "transfer" and "send"

            address payable is an address you can send Ether to
             while you are not supposed to send Ether to a plain address, 
             because it might be a smart contract that was not built to accept Ether.
