    An Application Binary Interface (ABI) is a collection of Fragments which specify 
        how to interact with various components of a Contract.

    An Interface helps  
        organize Fragments by type 
        provides the functionality required to 
            encode
            decode 
            work with each component

    Most developers will not require this "low-level access" to "encoding and decoding" the "binary data" on the network 
        and will most likely use a Contract which provides a more convenient interface. 
    Some framework, tool developers or developers using advanced techniques may find these classes and utilities useful.
