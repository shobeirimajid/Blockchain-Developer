avaScript/ECMAScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.

After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, 
    the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. 
    Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).

Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).

* Internet Explorer 9 did not support ES5 "use strict".
* Internet Explorer 11 does not support ES6.



ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification created to standardize JavaScript.

The Sixth Edition, 
    initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) 
    and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015, 
adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications, 

including :
    - classes 
    - modules
    - iterators 
    - for/of loops 
    - generators
    - arrow functions 
    - binary data
    - typed arrays
    - collections (maps, sets, weak maps)
    - promises
    - number and math enhancements
    - reflection
    - proxies

In other words, ES6 is a superset of JavaScript (ES5). 
The reason that ES6 became so popular is that 
it introduced new conventions and OOP concepts such as classes.
