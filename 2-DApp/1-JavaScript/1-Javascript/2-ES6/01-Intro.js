The Sixth Edition, 
    initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) 
    and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015, 
adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications, 

including :
    - classes 
    - modules
    - iterators 
    - for/of loops 
    - generators
    - arrow functions 
    - binary data
    - typed arrays
    - collections (maps, sets, weak maps)
    - promises
    - number and math enhancements
    - reflection
    - proxies

In other words, ES6 is a superset of JavaScript (ES5). 
The reason that ES6 became so popular is that 
it introduced new conventions and OOP concepts such as classes.
