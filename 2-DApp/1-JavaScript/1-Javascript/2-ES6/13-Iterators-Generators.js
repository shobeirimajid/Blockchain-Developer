    Iterators & Generators
    ---------------------------
    Symbol.iterator is the default iterator for an object. 
    
    The for...of loops are based on this type of iterator.

    In the example below, we will see how we should implement it 
    and how `generator functions` are used.

    Example:

            let myIterableObj = { 

                [Symbol.iterator] : function* () {
                    yield 1; 
                    yield 2; 
                    yield 3;
                }

            };

            console.log([...myIterableObj]);    // [ 1, 2, 3 ]


            First, we create an object, and use the Symbol.iterator 
            
            and `generator function` to fill it with some values.

    In the second line of the code, we use a * with the function keyword. 
            
    It's called a `generator function` (or `gen` function).

    For example, here is a simple case of how gen functions can be useful:


            function* idMaker() {

                let index = 0;

                while (index < 5)
                    yield index++;

            }
            var gen = idMaker();

            console.log(gen.next().value);
            console.log(gen.next().value);
            console.log(gen.next().value);
            console.log(gen.next().value);
            console.log(gen.next().value);

            // Try to add one more console.log, just like the above see what happens.


    We can exit and re-enter generator functions later. 

    Their variable bindings (context) will be saved across re-entrances. 
    
    They are a very powerful tool for asynchronous programming, 
    especially when combined with Promises. 
    
    They can also be useful for creating loops with special requirements.

    We can nest generator functions inside each other 
      to create more complex structures 
      and pass them arguments while we are calling them.

    The example below will show a useful case of 
    how we can use generator functions and Symbol.iterators together.

    Example:

            const arr = ['0', '1', '4', 'a', '9', 'c', '16'];
            const my_obj = {
            [Symbol.iterator]: function*() {
                for(let index of arr) {
                yield `${index}`;
                }
            }
            };

            const all = [...my_obj]             // Here you can replace the '[...my_obj]' with 'arr'. 
                .map(i => parseInt(i, 10))
                .map(Math.sqrt)
                .filter((i) => i < 5)               // try changing the value of 5 to 4 see what happens.
                .reduce((i, d) => i + d);           // comment this line while you are changing the value of the line above

            console.log(all);   // 10


    We create an object of 7 elements 
    by using `Symbol.iterator` and `generator functions` 

    In the second part, 
    we assign our object to a constant all. 
    
    At the end, we print its value.
