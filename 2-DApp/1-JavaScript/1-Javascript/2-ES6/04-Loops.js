    -------------------------
    Loops in ECMAScript 6
    -------------------------
    In JavaScript we commonly use the 'for' loop to iterate over values in a 'list':

            let arr = [1, 2, 3];

            for (let k = 0; k < arr.length; k++) {
                console.log(arr[k]);
            }


    The for...in loop is intended for iterating over the enumerable 'keys' of an 'object'.

    For example:

            let obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};

            for (let v in obj) {
                console.log(v); 
            }

            Output: 
            a
            b
            c


    The for...in loop should NOT be used to iterate over arrays 
        because, depending on the JavaScript engine, 
        it could iterate in an arbitrary order. 
    
    Also, the iterating variable 
        is a string, not a number, 
        so if you try to do any math with the variable, 
        you'll be performing string concatenation instead of addition.

    
    ES6 introduces the new for...of loop, 
    which creates a loop iterating over iterable objects.

    For example:

            let list = ["x", "y", "z"];
            for (let val of list) {
                console.log(val);
            }

            Output: 
            x
            y
            z

    During each iteration 
    the val variable is assigned the corresponding element in the list.

    The for...of loop works for other iterable objects as well, 
    including strings:

            for (let ch of "Hello") {
                console.log(ch);
            }

            Output: 
                    H 
                    e 
                    l
                    l 
                    o 
    
    The 'for...of' loop also works on the newly introduced collections :
        Map
        Set
        WeakMap
        WeakSet
    
    We will learn about them in the upcoming lessons.

    Note that ES6 code will run only in browsers that support it. 
    Older devices and browsers that do not support ES6 will return a syntax error.
