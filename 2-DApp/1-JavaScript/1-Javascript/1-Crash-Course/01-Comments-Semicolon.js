Comments
----------------------
JavaScript comments can be used to e

    explain JavaScript codes
    make codes more readable
    prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

There is two types of comments in Javascript:

    - Single-line comments
    - Multiline comments

It is most common to use single line comments.
Block comments are often used for formal documentation.
*/


// Single-line comments start with two slashes.


/* 
    Multiline comments start with slash-star,
    and end with star-slash 
*/



/*
----------------------
Semicolon
----------------------
Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.
semicolons are automatically inserted wherever there's a newline, except in certain cases.
Because those cases can cause unexpected results, we'll keep on using semicolons in this guide.

    console.log("HelloWorld");
    console.log("Tis is my first example")

/*
    JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. 
    You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
    The following lines are equivalent:
*/
    person = "Hege";
    person="Hege";
