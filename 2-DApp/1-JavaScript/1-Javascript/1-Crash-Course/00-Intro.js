What is Javascript
----------------------
JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language of the Web.

JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML          define the content of web pages

   2. CSS           specify the layout of web pages

   3. JavaScript    program the behavior of web pages


JavaScript is:

    - lightweight 
    - object-oriented
    - Open (Free)
    - cross-platform
    - Full integration with HTML/CSS
    - Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default



----------------------
History
----------------------
 
in 1995 core JavaScript language invented by Brendan to “make web pages alive” 
    was named as "scripts" or "LiveScript"


in 1997 Netscape changed its name to "JavaScript" 
    and became an ECMA standard "standard version of JavaScript" 
    ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1) was released and support it in Netscape 2.0 browser
    and then was supported by IE4 browser.
        * `ECMA-262` is the official name of the standard
        * `ECMAScript` is the official name of the language


The ECMAScript 5 standard will be the first update to be released in over 4 years. 
    and the difference between the two is extremely minor.
    JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard, 
    The specification for JavaScript 2.0 can be found on the following site: http://www.ecmascript.org/

Today, Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript conform to the ECMAScript standard, 
    although both the languages still support the features that are not a part of the standard.



--------------------------
frameworks and libraries
--------------------------
There are many useful Javascript frameworks and libraries available:

    - Angular
    - React
    - jQuery
    - Vue.js
    - Ext.js
    - Ember.js
    - Meteor
    - Mithril
    - Node.js
    - Polymer
    - Aurelia
    - Backbone.js



-----------------------------
Languages “over” JavaScript
-----------------------------
The syntax of JavaScript does not suit everyone’s needs. 
Different people want different features.

That’s to be expected, because projects and requirements are different for everyone.

So, recently a plethora of new languages appeared, 
  which are transpiled (converted) to JavaScript before they run in the browser.

Modern tools make the transpilation very fast and transparent, 
  actually allowing developers to code in another language and auto-converting it “under the hood”.

Examples of such languages:

CoffeeScript 
----------------
is “syntactic sugar” for JavaScript. 
It introduces shorter syntax, allowing us to write clearer and more precise code. 
Usually, Ruby devs like it.

TypeScript
----------------
is concentrated on adding “strict data typing” to simplify the development 
  and support of complex systems. 
It is developed by Microsoft.

Flow
----------------
also adds data typing, but in a different way. 
Developed by Facebook.

Dart
----------------
is a standalone language that has its own engine 
that runs in non-browser environments (like mobile apps), 
but also can be transpiled to JavaScript. 
Developed by Google.

Brython
----------------
is a Python transpiler to JavaScript 
that enables the writing of applications in pure Python without JavaScript.

Kotlin
----------------
is a modern, concise and safe programming language that can target the browser or Node.



----------------------------
Applications of Javascript
----------------------------
JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, 
  but it is now used in many other environments as well.

JavaScript usage has now extended to 
    - mobile app development
    - desktop app development
    - game development
    - Web3 or Blockchain-based Applications (DApp)

JavaScript is already running in 
    - your browser on your computer
    - on your tablet
    - and on your smart-phone


Client side validation
-----------------------
This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server 
and Javascript plays an important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.

Manipulating HTML Pages
-----------------------
Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. 
This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript 
and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.

User Notifications
-----------------------
You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages 
to give different types of notifications to your website visitors.

Back-end Data Loading
-----------------------
Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end data 
   while you are doing some other processing. 
This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.

Presentations
-----------------------
JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations which gives website look and feel. 
JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a web-based slide presentations.

Server Applications
-----------------------
Node JS is built on Chrome's Javascript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. 
This is an event based library 
which helps in developing very sophisticated server applications including Web Servers.




-----------------------
