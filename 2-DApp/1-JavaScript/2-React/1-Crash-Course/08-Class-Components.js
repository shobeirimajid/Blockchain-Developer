////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Before React 16.8, Class components were the only way to track `state` and `lifecycle` on a React component. 
// Function components were considered "state-less".

// With the addition of `Hooks` , 
// Function components are now almost equivalent to Class components. 

// The differences are so minor that you will probably never need to use a Class component in React.

// Even though Function components are preferred, 
// there are no current plans on removing Class components from React.



// This section will give you an overview of how to use Class components in React.
