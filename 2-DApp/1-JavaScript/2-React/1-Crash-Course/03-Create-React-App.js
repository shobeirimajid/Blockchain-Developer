//--------------------------
//  Create React App
//--------------------------

// To learn and test React, you should set up a `React Environment` on your computer.

// This tutorial uses the `create-react-app`

// The `create-react-app` tool is an officially supported way to create React applications.

// `Node.js` is required to use create-react-app.

// Open your terminal in the directory you would like to create your application.

// Run this command to create a React application named my-react-app:

//          npx create-react-app my-react-app

// create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application.

// Note: If you've previously installed create-react-app globally, 
// it is recommended that you uninstall the package 
// to ensure npx always uses the latest version of create-react-app. 

// To uninstall, run this command: 

//          npm uninstall -g create-react-app



//----------------------------
// Run the React Application
//----------------------------
// Run this command to move to the my-react-app directory:
//          cd my-react-app
// Run this command to execute the React application my-react-app:
//          npm start
// A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! 
// If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.
