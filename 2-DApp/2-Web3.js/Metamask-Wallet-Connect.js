How to integrate Metamask with a website with code.

1. Install the Metamask extension in your browser.

2. Once Metamask is installed, create a new Metamask account or connect your existing account to your browser.




3. In your website code, add the Metamask provider to your application. You can do this by adding the following code to your HTML header:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@metamask/dapp-provider@1.2.0/dist/metamask-provider.min.js"></script>




4. Initialize the Metamask provider by adding the following code to your JavaScript file:

const provider = new window.ethereum;
await provider.enable();



5. With the provider enabled, you can now interact with the Ethereum blockchain. For example, you can use Web3.js to query Ethereum data or send transactions.



6. To display the Metamask Connect button on your website, you can add a button with the Metamask logo and a click event that triggers the Metamask enable function:

<button onclick="window.ethereum.enable()">Connect to Metamask</button>



6. Once the user clicks the Connect to Metamask button, they will be prompted to connect their Metamask account to your website.

7. You can now interact with the user's Metamask account and send transactions on their behalf.
