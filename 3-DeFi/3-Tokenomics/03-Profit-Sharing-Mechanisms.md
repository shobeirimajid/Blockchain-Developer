Analyzing profit-sharing mechanisms
---------------------------------------------

There are three main `profit-sharing` models projects can utilize:

1. Buyback-and-Burn
Using (part of the) profits to `buy the project's native token` and sending it to the null address, thereby `burning` it which `reduces the token supply`.

2. Buyback-and-Distribute
Using (part of the) profits to `buy the project's native token` and `distribute it to stakeholders`, for example, stakers.

3. Distribute
Using (part of the) profits and `directly distributing them to stakeholders`, for example, stakers. Usually a `non-native token`, such as ETH or USDC.


While `buyback-and-Burn` is similar to a `stock buyback`, the latter two resemble dividends, but in different denominators (native token vs non-native token). 
Diving deeper however reveals more fundamental differences between the two.

We can evaluate the (potential) effects of the three distinct `profit-sharing mechanisms` on `different variables`, namely `tax effect`, impact on the `token price` and `value accrual`, and equality in the `distribution of rewards`.


---------------------------------------------
Effects on Token price
---------------------------------------------
Both systems which are using `buybacks` make the `token price go up` and holders are happy!

Their default mode is `selling profits` to `buy more tokens`, thereby automatically “compounding” profits for token holders. 

Both times, token holders `increased their share` in the project, either because the supply decreased (Buyback-and-Burn”) or because they received more tokens (Buyback-and-Distribute). 

The Distribute model’s default mode isn’t impacting the token price. Dividend receivers need to actively buy the native token with their profit shares. 

Therefore, it’s safe to assume that `buyback models` will have a bigger impact on the `short-term token price` than the `Distribute model`. 

At worst, even if all recipients sell the native token to lock in their rewards, the price will revert to the level prior to the buyback, the same price the Distribute model will result in (no price impact).

* Assuming no `sandwich attack` on the buyback or LPs pulling liquidity in the time between buyback and profit lock-in by token holders.

Note: 
Both `buyback models` only have a `direct impact on token price` if they are done on the `open market`.


the `Distribute model` would result in `buy pressure` by `value investors`, which results in a `higher price`, and in turn a `higher P/E ratio`. 

On a long enough timeframe, no matter the profit-sharing method, valuation will fluctuate around and then converge towards an equilibrium.

What differs is the `variance`, influenced by the `market participants mental models`. 
In the crypto market where most people only look at prices, especially in a bull market, reflexivity is high, leading to more variance (stronger boom-and-bust cycles).

In the end, the `profit distribution logic` doesn’t affect the `value captured by a business`. 
It does however determine how stakeholders can capture that value (profit) themselves.  


---------------------------------------------
Which model is better?
---------------------------------------------
The popular `Buyback-and-Burn` mostly acts as a `value signalling tool` (some would call it `price manipulation`), 
but ultimately seems inferior to the `Buyback-and-Distribute`, and especially the `Distribute model` in most cases.

While a `Buyback-and-Distribute` system adds the flexibility of sharing profits with specific, valuable stakeholders, 
the `Distribute system` seems more equal and fairer by not making profit lock-in competitive between stakeholders and not sending short-term price signals to the market via buybacks.

The `Distribute model` appears to be the most recommendable:

1. All recipients receive an `equal profit share` (if rewards are paid in stablecoins or a highly liquid token like ETH).
2. Everyone keeps their existing `share of the protocol` measured as the `percentage of the total supply`.
3. Distribution can target specific users.
