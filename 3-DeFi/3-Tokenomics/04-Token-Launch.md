When to launch
---------------------------------------------
`launching the product before the token` is becoming increasingly common and allows for the product to hopefully find a constant user base prior to token rewards beginning.

However, `launching the token` after the product may not be always possible, 
especially if the `token is required for utility` within the product (such as a blockchain which requires the token for securing the network) 
or if the `team has self-funded` and requires fundraising via token sales to further development.



---------------------------------------------
Where to launch
---------------------------------------------
When thinking about where to launch, there are multiple options that projects will incorporate to balance the value add from investors, attract different types of investors and decentralization of holders.

Some of the major options are listed below in which a project may use 1 or a combination of them:


1. Initial coin offering (ICO)
----------------------------------
The `crypto equivalent` of an `initial public offering (IPO)` used in traditional markets, ICOs were previously the biggest `crypto start-up fundraising` tool, ahead of venture capital and `before launching on a dex` was common.

An `initial coin offering` works by `selling tokens in exchange` for another cryptocurrency such as ETH with the price and supply of tokens for sale being either static or dynamic, depending on the sales conditions. 

Generally an ICO is conducted at the `very early stages of a project's life cycle`, before a `product` or potentially even a `whitepaper` has been released.

ICOs have come `under regulatory scrutiny` during the `2017/18 boom-bust cycle` as they are seen to be `unregulated` and `high risk` investment vehicles and there are concerns around the status of the tokens raising via ICO being considered securities under U.S. securities law.  


2. Pre-sales
----------------------------------
`Pre-sales` can come in various forms such as:
    a. `seed round`
    b. `private round` 
    c. `public sale`

These token sales are a way to `distribute your token` into the hands of `early supporters` who will be `stakeholders` at the launch and beyond.

Tokens are `sold at a discount` to these investors as a way to `incentivise` them to assist with `funding` throughout the `early stages` of a project's life cycle. 

Generally, for `seed` and `private` round investors there is some token vesting component, however for `public sale participants` these tokens are (generally) `liquid upon launch`. 



3. Initial DEX offering (IDO)
----------------------------------
An IDO is a popular method of `launching a token` amongst web3 native and DeFi protocols. 
This is due to the target audience usually owning a `self custody wallet` and `operating on chain` using DEXs.

`Initial DEX offerings` have many benefits for projects looking to use their `token launch` as a `fundraising mechanism` and a way to distribute their token to the community. 

IDO’s also have a `low cost of listing` due to the fact that the `project can seed the liquidity pool` themselves which also allows them to have `immediate liquidity` for the token to be traded. 



4. Initial exchange offering (IEO)
----------------------------------
IEOs are similar to IDO, except launched on a `centralized exchange` rather than a decentralized exchange. 

`The exchange` that the token is launching on will charge a `fee` for its `marketing services` and also its `infrastructure` to facilitate the launch. 

A `market maker` will also have to be employed to `provide liquidity` and allow for the `post-launch price discovery` to be facilitated.

IEOs are very popular for more ‘normie’ crypto projects whose target audience may not be familiar with transacting on-chain via a decentralized exchange. IEOs generally offer a sense of legitimacy or confidence to the launch as the exchange launching the token (should) complete some due diligence checks and also has reputation damage at risk. 

Some other benefits of an IEO include:

Security for both the token issuers and investors: Token issuers gain as well since centralized exchange platforms manage all things related to regulations, such as mandatory KYC/AML checks for every participant.

Frictionless process: IEO platforms ensure almost anyone, regardless of their experience in the crypto space, can easily contribute.

Guaranteed exchange listing: IEO tokens are listed on the IEO exchange soon after the IEO.

Benefits for the projects: Such as enhanced marketing effort by the exchange, exposure, and interest in the project.

Benefits for the exchanges: Including new users signing up with them only for the sake of purchasing and trading IEO tokens.

IEOs also have some drawbacks due to the current unclear regulatory landscape and forcing investors to complete KYC checks, potential market manipulation, unclear supply dynamics and bots that may front run the launch.
