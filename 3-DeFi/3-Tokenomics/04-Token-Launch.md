---------------------------------------------
When to launch
---------------------------------------------
`launching the product before the token` is becoming increasingly common and allows for the product to hopefully find a constant user base prior to token rewards beginning.

However, `launching the token` after the product may not be always possible, 
especially if the `token is required for utility` within the product (such as a blockchain which requires the token for securing the network) 
or if the `team has self-funded` and requires fundraising via token sales to further development.



---------------------------------------------
Where to launch
---------------------------------------------
When deciding where to launch, it is important to :

- first determine `who your target market of launch participants are`. 

- consider the `expenses for each launch type`, such as `market-making expenses` with a professional firm like GSR or the `cost of providing the liquidity yourself`. 

- consider the `utility of your token` within your product and `where` you would like the `majority of your tokens to be located`. 
If your token has `utility within the product` and is used for `staking` or `governance` then `launching on a decentralized exchange` may be best as the tokens will be needed on chain to be utilised within the product. 


There are multiple options to launch the Tokens. Some of the major options are listed below in which a project may use 1 or a combination of them:


1. Initial coin offering (ICO)
----------------------------------
The `crypto equivalent` of an `initial public offering (IPO)` used in traditional markets, ICOs were previously the biggest `crypto start-up fundraising` tool, ahead of venture capital and `before launching on a dex` was common.

An `initial coin offering` works by `selling tokens in exchange` for another cryptocurrency such as ETH with the price and supply of tokens for sale being either static or dynamic, depending on the sales conditions. 

Generally an ICO is conducted at the `very early stages of a project's life cycle`, before a `product` or potentially even a `whitepaper` has been released.

ICOs have come `under regulatory scrutiny` during the `2017/18 boom-bust cycle` as they are seen to be `unregulated` and `high risk` investment vehicles and there are concerns around the status of the tokens raising via ICO being considered securities under U.S. securities law.  


2. Pre-sales
----------------------------------
`Pre-sales` can come in various forms such as:
    a. `seed round`
    b. `private round` 
    c. `public sale`

These token sales are a way to `distribute your token` into the hands of `early supporters` who will be `stakeholders` at the launch and beyond.

Tokens are `sold at a discount` to these investors as a way to `incentivise` them to assist with `funding` throughout the `early stages` of a project's life cycle. 

Generally, for `seed` and `private` round investors there is some token vesting component, however for `public sale participants` these tokens are (generally) `liquid upon launch`. 



3. Initial DEX offering (IDO)
----------------------------------
An IDO is a popular method of `launching a token` amongst web3 native and DeFi protocols. 
This is due to the target audience usually owning a `self custody wallet` and `operating on chain` using DEXs.

`Initial DEX offerings` have many benefits for projects looking to use their `token launch` as a `fundraising mechanism` and a way to distribute their token to the community. 

IDOâ€™s also have a `low cost of listing` due to the fact that the `project can seed the liquidity pool` themselves which also allows them to have `immediate liquidity` for the token to be traded. 



4. Initial exchange offering (IEO)
----------------------------------
IEOs are similar to IDO, except launched on a `centralized exchange` rather than a decentralized exchange. 

`The exchange` that the token is launching on will charge a `fee` for its `marketing services` and also its `infrastructure` to facilitate the launch. 

A `market maker` will also have to be employed to `provide liquidity` and allow for the `post-launch price discovery` to be facilitated.

--------------------
Benefits
--------------------

- Popular
IEOs are `very popular` for more crypto projects whose target audience may not be familiar with transacting on-chain via a decentralized exchange. 

- Sense of legitimacy or confidence
IEOs generally offer a `sense of legitimacy` or `confidence` to the launch as the exchange launching the token (should) complete some due diligence checks and also has reputation damage at risk. 

- Security for both the token issuers and investors
`Token issuers` gain as well since centralized exchange `platforms manage all things related to regulations`, such as mandatory `KYC/AML checks` for every participant.

- Frictionless process
IEO platforms ensure almost `anyone, regardless of their experience in the crypto space`, can easily contribute.

- Guaranteed exchange listing
IEO tokens are `listed on the IEO exchange` soon after the IEO.

- Benefits for the projects
Such as enhanced `marketing` effort by the exchange, `exposure`, and `interest` in the project.

- Benefits for the exchanges
Including `new users` signing up with them only for the sake of purchasing and trading IEO tokens.

--------------------
Drawbacks
--------------------
IEOs also have some drawbacks due to the:
- current `unclear regulatory` landscape 
- `forcing investors` to complete KYC checks
- potential market manipulation
- unclear supply dynamics 
- bots that may front run the launch


5. Liquidity bootstrapping pool (LBP)
----------------------------------
Liquidity bootstrapping pools are `a novel launch design product` by Balancer. 
These `smart pools` are owned by a `smart contract` and allow any sort of `arbitrary logic` to be built. 

In the token launch scenario, you can think of the `starting price` of your LBP `as the ceiling` you would want to set for the token sale. 

This may seem counterintuitive, but since LBPs work differently than other token sales, your `starting price` should be set `much higher` than what you believe is the `fair price` for your token.

By setting an intentionally `high price`, strongly `disincentivises whales and bots` from snatching up much of the `pool liquidity` from the beginning of the launch. 

When LBPs are used for `early-stage tokens`, this mechanism can help to `increase` how widespread `the token distribution` is.

LBPs allow teams to `build deeper liquidity` for their tokens with `lower upfront capital costs`.


6. Initial farm offering (IFO)
----------------------------------
In some cases, a token may be distributed to the community via a `IFO` / `liquidity mining campaign` or boosted rewards for using the product.

These launch mechanisms are usually `more common` with products that `can function without the need for a token`. 

This token may be `utilized as a reward` prior to TGE and `distributed to users` of the product upon TGE which can be used to `pair liquidity`. 

The token is then `distributed to the greater community` via `token emissions on liquidity pools` or via `emissions to users of the protocol`, for example, `lenders and borrowers` on a money market.



---------------------------------------------
Picking a trading pair
---------------------------------------------
If you plan to have your token `tradable` on a `decentralized exchange` it will require `a token to be paired with`. 
This token should ideally be a `common`, `highly liquid` token such as ETH or USDC. 

In the current times of aggregators, it no longer matters if the buyer has the token in their wallet but this token pairing is aimed more at `what your liquidity providers would like to have exposure to`. 

If you `pick a more obscure pair`, this may lower the appeal for a `liquidity provider` to provide liquidity to your token as they may not want exposure to the paired asset, thus the `liquidity may be lower`.

The `most common pairs` and ones we would advise are `ETH` or the `L1 governance token`, such as `AVAX` or `SOL` and a `USD-pegged stablecoin` such as `USDC`, `DAI` or `FRAX` (or any of the other liquid stablecoins). 

As the `token price` is set between the `ratio of the two tokens in the pool`, utilizing `ETH` or a `USD stablecoin` will have different `price effects` as the `overall market` moves.

If you want `exposure to the broader crypto market` then pairing against `ETH` is your best bet, 
if you want to be `more conservative` and your `token to trade more independently` then pairing against a `USD stablecoin` is the way to go.


---------------------------------------------
Trading liquidity target
---------------------------------------------
After deciding what to `pair` your token with, the next step is figuring out `how much liquidity` is required. 

There is `no exact science in calculating a liquidity target` but having a goal of `15-20 %` of `your circulating market cap` in `liquidity` is a good target.

This will allow for `larger-sized investors` to enter and exit your token without incurring `too much slippage` and also allow for `smooth price discovery`.

A good resource is this liquidity cap target doc:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fchtxg6hq2gBC4WcMoQ8OFgMv84BZLDIT5pOm9Z18w4/edit#gid=656976389
created by @wvaeu and @mechanismcap. 

It shows `how much liquidity is required` for incremental `trade sizes` to maintain a <2% `slippage` target for an `80/20 Balancer pool` and a regular `50/50 uniswap-v2 style pool`.





---------------------------------------------
how to obtain that liquidity
---------------------------------------------




1. Liquidity Mining / Rent
`Renting of liquidity`, or better known as `liquidity mining` is the practice of `incentivising liquidity providers` to provide liquidity for your tokens in exchange for `governance token rewards`. 

Pioneered by `Synthetix` in early 2020, and subsequently made famous by `Compound`, high emissions and insane APRs were the narrative of DeFi summer. 

In what looks similar to an equity give away, `liquidity mining programs` have shown to be quite effective in `bootstrapping liquidity` for `early stage projects`. 

Tokens are emitted by the protocol to `attract liquidity providers` in the hope of them `depositing liquidity` which will allow the protocol to function or the `governance token to be tradeable` on the open market.



    - Some `positives` of `liquidity mining` are:

- Acts as a means of `distributing the governance token` to those who are providing work to the protocol (`providing liquidity`). 
`Protocols` often have a `treasury` full of `tokens which need to be distributed to the community`. 
By distributing these tokens to `actors helping with liquidity` this allows `governance power` to be in the hands of `users` rather than just `investors`.

- Low `up-front cost to attract liquidity` as liquidity can be purchased on a block by block basis. 
`Pairing liquidity` is `expensive` as the protocol has to `provide the other side` with `funds` from investors and `token sales`, if there are not enough funds raised, `renting liquidity` is the most `cost effective option` in the short term.

- `Liquidity can be attracted very quickly`, due to the fact that a `high APR` acts `as a marketing tactic`. 
`Farmers` are always on the lookout for the next `high APR farm` and will `move their capital` to the `highest yielding option` at that time.



    - Some `negatives` of `liquidity mining` are:

- Significant sell pressure
`Inflationary token emission` incentives short-term behavior that `increases sell pressure` on the `farm tokens`. 
Mercenary `liquidity providers` often `sell their rewards` to recoup their investments. 

- Goal misalignment between `protocols` and `liquidity providers`
`liquidity providers` are incentivised by `higher reward rates`, rather than a `strong belief in the success of the protocol`. 
Hence, when the rewards are scaled back or exhausted, the liquidity providers will remove their capital and move on to the next opportunity.

- Impermanent Loss (IL)
The `success of a protocol` causes `price appreciation in its native token`, causing a `significant impermanent loss scenario` for `liquidity providers`. 
This `misalignment` disincentivises `long-term LPs` even if they are long-term believers in the protocol.

- No buyer of last resort
During a `market crash` or in times of `uncertainty`, LPs tend to remove their liquidity from the pool as they run for safety. 
It is at these moments when liquidity is needed the most and if there is `insufficient liquidity` depth, it will lead to a `downward death spiral` of the `protocol's token price`.



2. Bribe
`Bribing for liquidity` is the common term used to describe `incentivising governance token holders` of another protocol to direct their `voting power` in the direction that the briber chooses. 

These `governance token holders` are `incentivised with tokens` that are in addition to their `regular governance token rewards`.

`Incentivised voting (bribing)` was made popular by protocols (such as Frax) bribing veCRV holders to direct CRV gauge emissions to their pools on Curve. 

By doing this, Frax was able to gain high amounts of CRV emissions on their FRAX pools which then can be used as income from protocol-owned liquidity (POL) and attracts other liquidity providers to these pools, which in turn creates deep liquidity which is a must-have of any pegged assets.

`Bribing for liquidity` quickly grew in popularity, with protocols bribing `CVX holders` for their `governance power` over the `Curve protocol` and then expanding to other meta-governance protocols. 

Currently, almost any protocol with a `vote-escrow token design` has a `meta-governance protocol` built on top and a bribe market facilitating incentivised voting to the base vote-escrow token holders.

Although bribing for liquidity does require a specific base asset design, such as Curve gauges to direct emissions, if you were planning on launching on Curve or Balancer there are marketplaces which facilitate incentivised voting to the governance token holders of these platforms.

    -Positives:

    Due to emissions being paid in other protocols governance tokens, yield can be earned on POL and sold without impacting the bribing protocols token price. This is especially true for protocols that own a large amount of their liquidity as the emissions directed to these pools can act as another form of revenue, or could be locked for additional governance power over the DEX the liquidity is pooled upon.

    Can be used to facilitate governance decisions as well as liquidity. Bribe marketplaces are also possible for general governance decisions. For example, you could bribe a DEX's governance token holder to be issued a gauge position on that DEX.


    - negatives:

    Only profitable in certain conditions. If there is large competition against other protocols that are also bribing this can drive up the necessary amount of tokens to be distributed to gain any sort of voting power, thus making bribing less profitable. 

    Profitability may also reduce as the price of the governance token emitted from the gauge emissions drops in price.

    Bribing for liquidity is only a temporary solution. Much like renting liquidity, bribing is only applicable for the current voting round. Once the bribing stops (or reduces), those votes will move to the next highest bidder and the emissions will reduce. In turn, LPs will usually chase the highest emissions so they will remove their liquidity from your pools.



3. Buy
`Buying liquidity` is a concept pioneered by `Olympus DAO` and their bonding program, now `Bond Protocol`. 
Bonding works by protocols offering up their `governance tokens` at a `discount` compared to the `market rate` in exchange for `assets` they would like to accrue. 
In the majority of cases these `assets` are their own `LP tokens`. 

By bonding their own LP tokens it allows the protocol to own its own liquidity. 
They are still emitting tokens to the market as is done with `renting` and `bribing`, although now they receive something in return that isnâ€™t temporary. 

Owning their own liquidity allows a protocol to earn trading fees from that liquidity that would usually be going to other LPs, minimize liquidity mining expenses (or end them all together) and build sustainable and reliable liquidity for their token. 

As mentioned earlier, if a project can aim for `15%-20% of its circulating market cap` in `liquidity`, ideally `60%-80% of this liquidity` would be owned by the protocol itself. 

This allows for `sufficient liquidity` to remain during all market conditions and will act as `another source of revenue` for the protocol.


    - negatives:

`Buying liquidity` is `expensive` due to the `bond discount` which is used to incentivise actors to visit a third party to bond their LP tokens rather than just buying the tokens off the open market. 
Without this discount the process doesn't work. 
Although this is expensive, it is `cheaper` than `giving the tokens out for free` as is the case with `renting and bribing` for liquidity.

Bonding usually involves outsourcing the process to a third party, such as Bond Protocol. This third party and additional contract interaction add further smart contract risk for the bonders and protocol.

Bonding tokens adds friction to an already poor UX. DeFi is still very difficult for the average user, so adding additional steps and complexities only reduces the market of users competent to perform them.

In addition to bonding for liquidity, fundraising can also be utilized to buy and own your own liquidity. Whether this is from a private or public sale, selling tokens (or future tokens) to investors during seed, pre-sale and public sale rounds is a great way to raise funds to pair with your liquidity. 


---------------------------------------------
Launch price
---------------------------------------------
Trying to determine the `best launch price` is one of the `hardest decisions` to make when launching a token. 

If you set the launch price `too low`, you may `miss out` on a `large amount of money` you could have earned with a `higher launch price`. 

If you set the price `too high`, there is a `risk` of those with `liquid tokens` at launch `selling their tokens` and `impacting the token price`, public perception of the protocol and risk reputation damage. 

Ideally, aiming for the `lower side` is a `safer` bet over the long term. 

This will `allow early investors` to (hopefully) see `some nice price` appreciation and `attract new investors`, `liquidity providers` and `users` to your protocol. 

Although the token is not a representation of the quality of the product, `good price action` can act as a `marketing tool` and gather the `attention` of the wider market.


What launch price is suitable ?
---------------------------------------------

1. Research your `competition` if you have any and `what their token launched at` and their `current market cap`. 
This will give you a `good insight` into what the market thought of their `launch price` and what is the `current perceived fair value` for their token. 
Always remember `first mover` advantage is something to consider, so even if you believe your product is better it may pay to be conservative with your comparison to the competition.


2. If you are `self-funding` your `liquidity pair`, this can be used to determine the `launch price`. 


-----------------------------------------
For example:
-----------------------------------------
`initial liquidity`        $500,000
`token release amount`     10% (10M)
`FDV`                      $5,000,000
`launch price`             $0.05
-----------------------------------------


3. Utilize a `bonding curve` or `auctions` and let the `market decide the price`. 
Bonding curves and auctions are perfect for `raising capital` to `seed initial liquidity` with and `distributing the token to the community` whilst also `letting the market` decide what a `fair launch price` is.
This is done in many different ways such as `English` or `Dutch` auctions or along a `pre-programmed price curve`. 
Although they all have their nuances, on the completion of the sale the `perceived fair price` is reached and this will determine the `public launch price`.


---------------------------------------------
Deterring mercenary capital
---------------------------------------------
Research from `Nansen` analyzed activity on `MasterChef.sol` contracts to try to `aggregate the data` and see `how to yield farmers were behaving`. 

Some of the results from this research were shocking, although not that surprising:

1. 
    - `A large majority of farmers` appear to `exit` within the `first 5 days` of entering a farm
    - `50%` of all farmers `never stay beyond 15 days`
    - `13%` of addresses still have their funds in these contracts

2. 
    - `42% of yield farmers` that enter a farm `on the day it launches` exit that farm `within 24 hours`. 
    - `16%` leave `within 48 hours` and by the `third day`, 
    - `70%` of the users who deposited on the `first day` of that farm had withdrawn from the contract. 

    This is believed to be caused by the reduction in emissions that occur each block post-launch.


As shown by this research, `deterring this mercenary capital` is of the utmost importance and can be done by `utilizing mechanisms` such as `locking` or `vesting rewards`. 

Requiring LPs to `loc`k their LP tokens for an extended period or to `earn boosted rewards` is a great way to filter out the mercenary capital and leave behind LPs who are prepared to stick around for the long term. 

These locks may vary in length from `1week` to `multiple months`, with `rewards being boosted` for those who `lock the longest`. 

`Vesting of rewards` was pioneered by GMX and has proven to be `extremely successful`. 
In the case of GMX, their token emissions are distributed as `esGMX`, a token with equal `reward` and `governance weight` as the `regular staked GMX token` without being liquid. 
These `esGMX tokens` can be vested over `1 year` if certain conditions are met, such as `keeping your tokens` or `liquidity staked`. 
Vesting rewards over a long period still rewards past and present stakes with protocol fees and governance rights but requires them to stick around to vest their tokens and sell them.

Conclusion
