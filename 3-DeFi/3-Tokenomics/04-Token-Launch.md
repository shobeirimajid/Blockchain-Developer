---------------------------------------------
When to launch
---------------------------------------------
`launching the product before the token` is becoming increasingly common and allows for the product to hopefully find a constant user base prior to token rewards beginning.

However, `launching the token` after the product may not be always possible, 
especially if the `token is required for utility` within the product (such as a blockchain which requires the token for securing the network) 
or if the `team has self-funded` and requires fundraising via token sales to further development.



---------------------------------------------
Where to launch
---------------------------------------------
When deciding where to launch, it is important to :

- first determine `who your target market of launch participants are`. 

- consider the `expenses for each launch type`, such as `market-making expenses` with a professional firm like GSR or the `cost of providing the liquidity yourself`. 

- consider the `utility of your token` within your product and `where` you would like the `majority of your tokens to be located`. 
If your token has `utility within the product` and is used for `staking` or `governance` then `launching on a decentralized exchange` may be best as the tokens will be needed on chain to be utilised within the product. 


There are multiple options to launch the Tokens. Some of the major options are listed below in which a project may use 1 or a combination of them:


1. Initial coin offering (ICO)
----------------------------------
The `crypto equivalent` of an `initial public offering (IPO)` used in traditional markets, ICOs were previously the biggest `crypto start-up fundraising` tool, ahead of venture capital and `before launching on a dex` was common.

An `initial coin offering` works by `selling tokens in exchange` for another cryptocurrency such as ETH with the price and supply of tokens for sale being either static or dynamic, depending on the sales conditions. 

Generally an ICO is conducted at the `very early stages of a project's life cycle`, before a `product` or potentially even a `whitepaper` has been released.

ICOs have come `under regulatory scrutiny` during the `2017/18 boom-bust cycle` as they are seen to be `unregulated` and `high risk` investment vehicles and there are concerns around the status of the tokens raising via ICO being considered securities under U.S. securities law.  


2. Pre-sales
----------------------------------
`Pre-sales` can come in various forms such as:
    a. `seed round`
    b. `private round` 
    c. `public sale`

These token sales are a way to `distribute your token` into the hands of `early supporters` who will be `stakeholders` at the launch and beyond.

Tokens are `sold at a discount` to these investors as a way to `incentivise` them to assist with `funding` throughout the `early stages` of a project's life cycle. 

Generally, for `seed` and `private` round investors there is some token vesting component, however for `public sale participants` these tokens are (generally) `liquid upon launch`. 



3. Initial DEX offering (IDO)
----------------------------------
An IDO is a popular method of `launching a token` amongst web3 native and DeFi protocols. 
This is due to the target audience usually owning a `self custody wallet` and `operating on chain` using DEXs.

`Initial DEX offerings` have many benefits for projects looking to use their `token launch` as a `fundraising mechanism` and a way to distribute their token to the community. 

IDOâ€™s also have a `low cost of listing` due to the fact that the `project can seed the liquidity pool` themselves which also allows them to have `immediate liquidity` for the token to be traded. 



4. Initial exchange offering (IEO)
----------------------------------
IEOs are similar to IDO, except launched on a `centralized exchange` rather than a decentralized exchange. 

`The exchange` that the token is launching on will charge a `fee` for its `marketing services` and also its `infrastructure` to facilitate the launch. 

A `market maker` will also have to be employed to `provide liquidity` and allow for the `post-launch price discovery` to be facilitated.

--------------------
Benefits
--------------------

- Popular
IEOs are `very popular` for more crypto projects whose target audience may not be familiar with transacting on-chain via a decentralized exchange. 

- Sense of legitimacy or confidence
IEOs generally offer a `sense of legitimacy` or `confidence` to the launch as the exchange launching the token (should) complete some due diligence checks and also has reputation damage at risk. 

- Security for both the token issuers and investors
`Token issuers` gain as well since centralized exchange `platforms manage all things related to regulations`, such as mandatory `KYC/AML checks` for every participant.

- Frictionless process
IEO platforms ensure almost `anyone, regardless of their experience in the crypto space`, can easily contribute.

- Guaranteed exchange listing
IEO tokens are `listed on the IEO exchange` soon after the IEO.

- Benefits for the projects
Such as enhanced `marketing` effort by the exchange, `exposure`, and `interest` in the project.

- Benefits for the exchanges
Including `new users` signing up with them only for the sake of purchasing and trading IEO tokens.

--------------------
Drawbacks
--------------------
IEOs also have some drawbacks due to the:
- current `unclear regulatory` landscape 
- `forcing investors` to complete KYC checks
- potential market manipulation
- unclear supply dynamics 
- bots that may front run the launch


5. Liquidity bootstrapping pool (LBP)
----------------------------------
Liquidity bootstrapping pools are `a novel launch design product` by Balancer. 
These `smart pools` are owned by a `smart contract` and allow any sort of `arbitrary logic` to be built. 

In the token launch scenario, you can think of the `starting price` of your LBP `as the ceiling` you would want to set for the token sale. 

This may seem counterintuitive, but since LBPs work differently than other token sales, your `starting price` should be set `much higher` than what you believe is the `fair price` for your token.

By setting an intentionally `high price`, strongly `disincentivises whales and bots` from snatching up much of the `pool liquidity` from the beginning of the launch. 

When LBPs are used for `early-stage tokens`, this mechanism can help to `increase` how widespread `the token distribution` is.

LBPs allow teams to `build deeper liquidity` for their tokens with `lower upfront capital costs`.


6. Initial farm offering (IFO)
----------------------------------
In some cases, a token may be distributed to the community via a `IFO` / `liquidity mining campaign` or boosted rewards for using the product.

These launch mechanisms are usually `more common` with products that `can function without the need for a token`. 

This token may be `utilized as a reward` prior to TGE and `distributed to users` of the product upon TGE which can be used to `pair liquidity`. 

The token is then `distributed to the greater community` via `token emissions on liquidity pools` or via `emissions to users of the protocol`, for example, `lenders and borrowers` on a money market.



---------------------------------------------
Picking a trading pair
---------------------------------------------
If you plan to have your token `tradable` on a `decentralized exchange` it will require `a token to be paired with`. 
This token should ideally be a `common`, `highly liquid` token such as ETH or USDC. 

In the current times of aggregators, it no longer matters if the buyer has the token in their wallet but this token pairing is aimed more at `what your liquidity providers would like to have exposure to`. 

If you `pick a more obscure pair`, this may lower the appeal for a `liquidity provider` to provide liquidity to your token as they may not want exposure to the paired asset, thus the `liquidity may be lower`.

The `most common pairs` and ones we would advise are `ETH` or the `L1 governance token`, such as `AVAX` or `SOL` and a `USD-pegged stablecoin` such as `USDC`, `DAI` or `FRAX` (or any of the other liquid stablecoins). 

As the `token price` is set between the `ratio of the two tokens in the pool`, utilizing `ETH` or a `USD stablecoin` will have different `price effects` as the `overall market` moves.

If you want `exposure to the broader crypto market` then pairing against `ETH` is your best bet, 
if you want to be `more conservative` and your `token to trade more independently` then pairing against a `USD stablecoin` is the way to go.


---------------------------------------------
Trading liquidity target
---------------------------------------------
After deciding what to `pair` your token with, the next step is figuring out `how much liquidity` is required. 

There is `no exact science in calculating a liquidity target` but having a goal of `15-20 %` of `your circulating market cap` in `liquidity` is a good target.

This will allow for `larger-sized investors` to enter and exit your token without incurring `too much slippage` and also allow for `smooth price discovery`.

A good resource is this liquidity cap target doc:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fchtxg6hq2gBC4WcMoQ8OFgMv84BZLDIT5pOm9Z18w4/edit#gid=656976389
created by @wvaeu and @mechanismcap. 

It shows `how much liquidity is required` for incremental `trade sizes` to maintain a <2% `slippage` target for an `80/20 Balancer pool` and a regular `50/50 uniswap-v2 style pool`.


Now you know `how much liquidity` to target, there are a few options on `how to obtain that liquidity` :


1. Liquidity Mining / Rent
`Renting of liquidity`, or better known as `liquidity mining` is the practice of `incentivising liquidity providers` to provide liquidity for your tokens in exchange for `governance token rewards`. 

Pioneered by `Synthetix` in early 2020, and subsequently made famous by `Compound`, high emissions and insane APRs were the narrative of DeFi summer. 

In what looks similar to an equity give away, `liquidity mining programs` have shown to be quite effective in `bootstrapping liquidity` for `early stage projects`. 

Tokens are emitted by the protocol to `attract liquidity providers` in the hope of them `depositing liquidity` which will allow the protocol to function or the `governance token to be tradeable` on the open market.


`Liquidity mining` does have some `positives`:

- Acts as a means of `distributing the governance token` to those who are providing work to the protocol (`providing liquidity`). 
`Protocols` often have a `treasury` full of `tokens which need to be distributed to the community`. 
By distributing these tokens to `actors helping with liquidity` this allows `governance power` to be in the hands of `users` rather than just `investors`.

- Low `up-front cost to attract liquidity` as liquidity can be purchased on a block by block basis. 
`Pairing liquidity` is `expensive` as the protocol has to `provide the other side` with `funds` from investors and `token sales`, if there are not enough funds raised, `renting liquidity` is the most `cost effective option` in the short term.

- `Liquidity can be attracted very quickly`, due to the fact that a `high APR` acts `as a marketing tactic`. 
`Farmers` are always on the lookout for the next `high APR farm` and will `move their capital` to the `highest yielding option` at that time.
